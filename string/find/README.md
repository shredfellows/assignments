# Finding Characters in a String

##  Problems
Here are three challenges based on finding the position and occurrence of characters in a string 

## Reminders 

 - You are not allowed to use any built-in methods, unless specified.
 
 - If you are unsure how to start any of these challenges, review the String.indexOf method:
	 - [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf)
- Some of the challenges may require you to account for special characters such as `!, # and %`.

## Example

Each problem will have a scaffold available for reference. While some scaffolds are more detailed than others, they will all contain the required  `inputs` and `outputs`.

    //input ('hello world!' , 2)
     
    function firstDuplicate(string) { 
     // your code here
    } 
    
    //output 'l'

## Stretch Goals

 -  Each challenge will feature its own stretch goal(s).
 - They are designed to be more challenging, but are worth considering if you find a challenge to be too easy
