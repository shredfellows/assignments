# Challenge 2

##  First Duplicate Character
Write a function called `firstDuplicate()` that takes a string. Return the first non-unique character that occurs in the string.

If the string is empty, return  `null` .

## Reminders

 - You are not allowed to use any built-in methods.
 - You do not have to account for capitalization.
 - You can refer to documentation if you get stuck:
	 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
	 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
- Remember to account for special characters such as `!, # and %`.

## Example

    //input ('hello world!')

    function firstDuplicate(string) {
     // your code here
    }

    //output 'l'

## Stretch Goals

 - Modify your function to accept two strings. Return the first character that exists in both of the strings.
