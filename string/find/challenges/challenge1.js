# Challenge 1

##  Occurrence of a Letter
Write a function called `charOccurence()` that takes a string and a character. Return the number of instances of that character in the string. If there are multiple characters with the same number of instances, return the one that occurs first. If the string is empty, return  `null` .

## Reminders

 - You are not allowed to use any built in methods.
 - You can refer to documentation if you get stuck:
	 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String
	 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
- Remember to account for special characters such as `!, # and %`.

## Example

    //input ('hello world!' , 'o')
     
    function charOccurence(string, char) { 
     // your code here
    } 
    
    //output 2
    
## Stretch Goals

 - Modify your function to return the second most occurring character in the string.
